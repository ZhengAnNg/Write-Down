**About**

This webpage is a to-do list/ planner. It allows the users to keep track of their work or appointments. Write Down allows users to note down tasks that need to be done, enabling users to see an overview of all the tasks for the day. Working similarly to a calendar, you can plan your schedule in advance. This allows users to see their urgent tasks, and plan their days and weeks accordingly.


**Main Page**

The main page consists of some of the application descriptions and features. On the side, there is the log in panel and creating new account panel. With a single click on "create new account", users are able to move from the default Log In panel to the "Register New Account" panel.

For the register page, there are some features to prevent errors from occurring, such as avoiding no input of either username, password, or re-enter password. Another error is when the username already exists and when the password and re-enter password do not match. If any of these errors occur, it will pop up an error message in red at the bottom stating the error. If no error occurs, users will see a "Account Created Successfully" text and a link to go back to the log in panel to proceed with the log in.

For the log in page, there are also some features to prevent log in. The errors include no input of username or password, and when the username or password is incorrect. When these errors occur, an error message will appear in red at the bottom stating the error. If no error occurs, the user will be logged in and redirected to the home page



**Home Page**

The home page includes all the tasks that the user keyed in, sorted by the deadline of the task. There are 4 colors associated with the tasks' importance level (very important, important, not important, completed). With the color red for very important, yellow for important, green for not important, and grey for completed. The task can be added by clicking on the "Add Task" button at the bottom middle of the page. On the left side of the tasks, there are 2 buttons (completed & delete). By clicking on 'completed', the color of the task will change from red, yellow, and green to grey which symbolizes completion. There is also the delete button which will just delete the task completely. At the very bottom of all these lists and below the "Add Task" button there is a 'Refresh' button which when clicked will refresh the tasks, updating the time. This refresh button will trigger a flashing red+white color when the task is less than a day from the deadline. This warns users of their deadline. At the top right corner of every page, there will also be a box to click on "home", "setting" and "log out", bring to their page accordingly, and log out just sign the user out and return to the main page.


**Add Task Page**

The add task page includes a few input boxes that requires users to key in their task name, deadline (date + time), description(optional), and importance level. For the deadline, users, when clicked, will have a mini calendar pop-up and can choose the deadline, for the time, will have a drop-down bar, allowing users to click and select the time of the deadline. The description section is just a big text area for users to key in, in case they need to elaborate on their task. Lastly, there is an importance level which is also a drop-down bar where they can select only 3 options, very important, important, not important. There are also some measures put in place, such as having no input for task name, deadline, or importance level. If any of these errors appear, an error message will appear in red at the bottom stating the error. If there is no error, this new task will now be added to the Home page with the importance level color reflected.


**Setting Page**

The setting page consists of 3 things, "Change Username", "Change Password" and "Theme", which can be clicked on to bring to the page accordingly.

Changing of username page includes 2 input boxes which are "New Username" and "re-enter New Username". To change the username, the user has to key in both input boxes and make sure the 2 inputs match. If not, an error message in red will appear at the bottom. If changed, a green message will appear at the bottom stating that the username has been successfully changed. This will also be reflected in the home page and settings page where it writes " (username)'s To Do List" and "(username)'s Setting" accordingly.

Changing password include 3 input boxes which are "Old Password", "New Password" and "re-enter New Password". To change the password, the user has to key in all 3 boxes, making sure that the old password is correct and the "new password" and "re-enter new password" input matches. If not, an error message at the bottom in red stating the error. If changed, a green message will appear at the bottom to let users know their password has been successfully changed.

Change theme page consists of 1 drop-down box which includes the default color "blue" and the subsequent colors, "green", "purple", "pink", "orange", "yellow", and "grey". By clicking on the color and clicking the "Change Theme", the selected color will be reflected immediately on the page. This will apply to all pages(after log in). Since the drop-down box starts off 'color' which is a disabled selection, an error message will appear in red at the bottom if no color is selected and 'color' is selected before clicking "Change Theme".
